# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
#- main
- dev

pr:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
#      - dev

variables:
  - name: vmImage
    value: 'ubuntu-latest'

stages:
  - stage: Release
    displayName: Release Stage
    condition: in(variables['build.sourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/dev')
    jobs:
      - job: ReleaseJob
        pool:
          vmImage: $(vmImage)
        steps:
          - template: jobs/release.yml

  - stage: Deploy
    displayName: Deploy Jar and publish artifact
    condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables['build.sourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main'))
    jobs:
        pool:
          vmImage: $(vmImage)
        steps:
          - template: jobs/deploy.yml
#        variables:
#          - template: Variables/prod.yml
#        strategy:
#          runOnce:
#            deploy:
#              steps:
#                - template: jobs/deploy.yml
